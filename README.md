## Add provider
In order to implement a new provider you need to perform these steps:
1. Implement the provider as a class that extends the Provider class
2. Implement inherited functions
3. Add lowercase provider name to global providers variable
4. Add case for provider in method get_provider

Then the new provider should be available.
